# 🤖 AI Avatar: Emotionally Intelligent Digital Being with Real-Time Knowledge 🌐💡

![AI Avatar Banner](screenshots/banner.jpg)

## 🚀 Vision

**AI Avatar** is an experimental project pushing the boundaries of emotionally aware AI, combining advanced **NLP**, **speech technologies**, **emotion detection**, and **facial animation** into a hyper-realistic virtual being. This prototype is built to understand, respond, and connect — like a human.

> 💡 *Our mission: Craft the world’s first emotionally intelligent AI that can engage in real-time conversations with empathy, awareness, and intelligence.*
